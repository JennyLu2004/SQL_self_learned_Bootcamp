# SQL_Self_Learned_Bootcamp
This Bootcamp is a project that I did during the summer of 2024 to learn SQL by myself. I was transitioning from a Freshman to a Sophomore in Data Science at the time and I wanted learn ahead, since this will give me an advantage and put an important skill under my belt.

The .sql file attached in this project has everything that I had learned about SQL using YouTube (mainly from Alex The Analyst and some other tech Youtubers). Things that I learned include: 
- Writing simple queries using (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc)
- Writing complex series using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and CASE statements
- Using GROUP BY and JOIN functions
- Customizing String objects with (TRIM, CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING)
- Creating temporary tables and triggers
- More...

This Bootcamp has taught me everything from the basics to the more advanced side of SQL. In addition, since it is a self-initiated project over the summer, it also helped me train my discipline and time management skill.
