# SQL Bootcamp Project
In the summer of 2024, I decided to dive into SQL on my own and created this Bootcamp project. At the time, I was transitioning from a freshman to a sophomore in Data Science, and I wanted to get a head start on learning a skill that I knew would be super important.

The .sql file attached to this project has everything I learned about SQL. Most of it came from YouTube (shoutout to Alex The Analyst and a few other tech YouTubers). Here's what I covered:

- Writing simple queries like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and more
- Tackling more advanced stuff like CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and CASE statements
- Using GROUP BY and JOIN functions
- Working with strings using TRIM, CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT, and SUBSTRING
- Creating temporary tables and triggers
... And a bunch of other cool things
This project really helped me go from zero to advanced SQL. Plus, since it was something I did over the summer on my own, it taught me a lot about staying disciplined and managing my time.
